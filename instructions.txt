i want you to help me develop a chrome extension to read the output from chatgpt. Here are the requirements:

* you will have to be activated by the user from popup.html at least once 
* once you've been activated, you will read the latest chatgpt response in the selected voice and speed. these will also be set in popup.html
* you will read each sentence once by one and highlight the sentence that you are currently reading
* once you're done, you will wait for the next response and start reading that automatically.
